  # EXPLICIT, not inferred. Homebrew guesses the version from the url filename,
  # and `bit-0.1.0-macos-aarch64.tar.xz` made it guess "64" - it took the digits
  # off `aarch64`. That installed into Cellar/bit/64, made `brew list --versions`
  # report "bit 64", and broke the `test do` block below, which asserts the
  # detected version appears in `bit version` output.

  # Before `license`, which is the order `brew audit` requires.
